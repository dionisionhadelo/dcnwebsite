       <strong><h2>EXPERIENCE</h2></strong>
    </header>
    <h3> Tutor of HPC, Linux Command Line and Python Programming</h3>
    <p> Worked as tutor for 2021 DARA students in Mozambique. The event was held at Eduardo Mondlane University under the coordination of Professor Dr. Cláudio Moisés Paulo. The first two parts of this had as main roll to introduce the student to the  Linux command line, bash scripting and python coding. The material that we used were prepared by the Centre For High Performance Computing (CHPC) based in South Africa, from which I had my first steps in HPC as DARA student (2018-2019). The last part of it was regarding data reduction and imaging using CASA, where I worked as an assistent of James Chibueze, the tutor for data reduction.</p>

    <h3>Organizer and tutor of DARA BIG DATA Hackathon</h3>
    <p>Worked as Organizer and tutor for the firs event of <a href="https://www.darabigdata.com/uem-hackathon-mozambique" target="_blank">DARA BIG DATA HACKATHON IN MOZAMBIQUE</a>. This was held in the Physics Department, Faculty of Science at Eduardo Mondlane University. Due to the restriction related to the COVID-19 we were able to admit only 24 participants divided into two groups. The first worked in the AstroLab and the second in the computer Lab of the Physics Department. In this event, we introduced image processing with python. The main role was to use satellite images and python skills to build a machine-learning model capable to detect flooded areas after the Cyclone Idai that hit Mozambique in 2019. </p>

    <h3>Intern at INGD</h3>
    <p>Worked as monitoring officer at the National Institute of Disaster Management. The role was to use meteorological models to predict areas that would possibly be affected under the extreme events of rainfall. After doing the prediction I had to use the arcGIS software to map those areas and keep track of this prediction for emergency alert emission. </p>

    <h3>Private Tutor</h3>
    <p>Used to work as a Private tutor for high school students, mostly in mathematics and physics. Also used to help students to prepare for the college exams admissions. This practice skilled me in terms of planning, organization and communication</p>

        <strong><h2>TRAINING</h2></strong>
    </header>
    <h3>Data Science Unit I</h3>
    <p>Certified in Applied Data Science for <strong><a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/1fb2eaa4-dd38-48a3-bc9e-b7f8104550ff/public_url" target="_blank">Scientific Computing and Python.</a></strong> was issued by the<strong> WorldQuant University.</strong> This module covered from basic to advanced Data Analysis, python syntax, python Data Structure, for and while loops. This was 8 weeks long module, self paced, composed by self studying, office hours, video lectures training material and graded mini-projects to be completed.</p>


    <h3>Data Science Unit II</h3>
    <p>This is the second module of Applied Data Science for <strong><a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/e66339ac-ca0c-402f-b647-2410ea59ca91/public_url" target="_blank">Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis.</a></strong> This online badge was also issued by the <strong>WorldQuant University</strong> .This was 8 weeks long module as well, which covered machine learning algorithms, building both supervise and unsupervised machine learning for anomaly detection and predictions, as well as usage of python's scikit-learn packages.</p>


    <h3>Python for Data Science</h3>
    <p>The badge <strong><a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/c1ddd571-da1d-45bd-8f47-cfa23dfd078f/public_url" target="_blank">Python for Data Science</a></strong>  was issued by <strong>IBM.</strong> This training had the following four modules: Python basics which covered types, expressions, variables and string operations; Python Data Structures covering lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries; Python programming fundamentals covering conditions, loops, functions, objects and classes and; Working with data in python which did cover reading and writing files, loading data, working with data and saving data with pandas.</p> 
    


    <h3>Principles of Satellite Remote-Sensing</h3>
    <p>Basic principles of satellite remote-sensing is one of the Massive Online Open Courses that was designed and offered by the China Meteorological Administration Training Centre <a href="http://mooc.cmatc.cma.cn/course/index.php?lang=en" target="_blank">(CMATC)</a>. This training consisted in video lectures, reading material and office hours for Q & A. This course was entirely based on FungYun satellites, the Chinese Meteorological satellites, both geostationary and polar orbits. The final stage of this training was to complete all the proposed tasks and write a feedback paper in order to get a <a href="docs/Certificate_Satellite_observations.pdf">certificate</a>.</p> 
    

    <h3>DARA Project</h3>
    <p>Mozambique Cohort-2  <a href="https://www.dara-project.org/" target="_blank">DARA</a> Student (2018-2019).This was a four units training program, where unit-1 covered an introduction to Astrophysics and Radio Astronomy; unit-2 covered Technical training that included theory and hands-on usage and maintance of telescopes, receiver and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) equipment, this unit also covered a computer training focused on Linux and Python scripting; unit-3 was about Radio Astronomy observations, where we used single-dish and VLBI observations and survey Astronomy; unit-4 we learned to use a very important tool for Radio Astronomy, making use of Common Astronomy software Application (CASA) we did VLBI data reduction and analysis. The units 1 and 2 took place in in Maputo at Eduardo Mondlane University and the units 2 and 3 took place in Krugersdorp at Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory (HartRAO).</p>

        <strong><h2>EDUCATION</h2></strong>
    </header>
    <p>Graduated in Atmospheric Science by Eduardo Mondlane University. My project consisted in evaluating the quality of CHIRPS satellite precipitation data in order to determine if they can be used for drought and flood monitoring in Mozambique. This phenomena are frequent in Mozambique, to monitor them data with high quality are required, and Mozambique has a lack of density meteorological ground stations, a good solution that can be adopted is to use remote-sensing estimated data.

        <h2>PERSONAL STATEMENT</h2>
    </header>
    <p>I’m always open for new challenges coming from others or myself. The best way I use to retain what I learn is to share, that's why I can easily team up to do a group work.  I'm dynamic, well organized and oriented to result. Good communication skills and good relationship with colleagues. I find myself a very responsible person.
