    <h3><p> Tutor of HPC, Linux Command Line and Python Programming</p></h3>
    <p>Worked as tutor for 2021 DARA students in Mozambique. The event was held at Eduardo Mondlane University under the coordination of Professor Dr. Cláudio Moisés Paulo. The first two parts of this had as main roll to introduce the student to the  Linux comammad line, bash scripting and python coding. The material that we used were prepared by the Centre For High Performance Computing (CHPC) based in South Africa, from which I had my first steps in HPC as DARA student (2018-2019). The last part of it was regarding data reduction and imaging using CASA, where I worked as an assistent of James Chibueze, the tutor for data reduction. </p>

    <h3>Organizer and tutor of DARA BIG DATA Hackathon</h3>
    <p>Worked as Organizer and tutor for the firs event of <a href="" target="_blank">DARA BIG DATA HACKATHON IN MOZAMBIQUE</a>. This was held in the Physics Department, Faculty of Science at Eduardo Mondlane University. Due to the restrition related to the COVID-19 we were able to admit only 24 participants divided into two groups. The first worked in the AstroLab and the second in the computer Lab of the Physics Department. In this event, we introduced image processing with python. The main role was to use satelite images and python skills to build a machine learning model capable to detect flooded areas after the Cyclone Idai that hit Mozambique in 2019. The rolle was to introduce to the </p>

    <h3>Intern at INGD</h3>
    <p>Worked as monitoring officer at the National Institute of Disaster Manangent. The role was to use meteorological models to predict areas that would  possibly be affected under the extreme events of rainfall. After doing the prediction I had to use the arcGIS software to map those areas and keep track of this prediction for alert emission when necessary. </p>

    <h3>Private Tutor</h3>
    <p>Used to work as a Private tutor</p>
